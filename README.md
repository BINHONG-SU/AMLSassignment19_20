Libraries used for this assignment: numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, cv2

The 'A1' folder cosists of  'A1.py' and 'data_A1.py'. 'A1.py' is for training and testing model as well as plot the learning curve. 'data_A1.py' is for getting the training data and testing data.

The 'A2' folder cosists of  'A2.py' and 'data_A2.py'. 'A2.py' is for training and testing model as well as plot the learning curve.'data_A2.py' is for getting the training data and testing data

The 'B1' folder cosists of  'B1.py' and 'data_B1.py'. 'B1.py' is for training and testing model as well as plot the learning curve. 'data_B1.py' is for getting the training data and testing data.

The 'B2' folder cosists of  'B2.py' and 'data_B2.py'. 'B2.py' is for training and testing model as well as plot the learning curve.'data_B2.py' is for getting the training data and testing data

Run the 'main.py' directly, it will display the pca variance kept for tasks A1,A2,B1 and B2. Then the selected best model, accuracy of validation set, training set and testing set for each task will be displayed.

If you want to show the learning curve for any task, in the 'main.py', i.e.,you need to delet the '#' in the '#model_A1.plot_learning_curve(X_train_A1,Y_train_A1)'.
